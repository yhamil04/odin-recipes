      These soft hamburger buns are perfect for burgers, pulled pork, or your
      favorite sandwich filling. I've gotten a thousand requests for these! Not
      only are these the perfect shape, but they taste way better than anything
      that comes out of a plastic bag. The total time takes almost 4 hours, but
      the actual amount of work involved is maybe 10 minutes.

      Sure, you could buy hamburger buns at the grocery store — but where's the
      fun in that? It's easier than you think to make homemade hamburger buns,
      and they're way more delicious than the store-bought alternative.

    <h4>How to Make Hamburger Buns</h4>

    <p>
      It couldn't be easier to make these homemade hamburger buns. You'll find
      the step-by-step recipe below — but here's a brief overview of what you
      can expect:
    </p>

    <ol>
      <li>Make the dough.</li>
      <li>Let the dough rise.</li>
      <li>Form the buns.</li>
      <li>Bake the buns, then let them cool completely.</li>
      <li>Slice the buns in half lengthwise.</li>
    </ol>

    <p>
      Begin by proofing the yeast with some of the flour. Once the yeast is
      foamy, add the remaining flour, an egg, butter, sugar, and salt. Fit a
      stand mixer with a dough hook and knead the dough, scraping the sides
      often, until it's soft and sticky.
    </p>
    <p>
      Transfer the dough to a floured surface and form into a smooth, round
      ball. Tuck the ends underneath and return the dough to an oil-drizzled
      stand mixer bowl. Ensure the dough is coated with oil, then cover and
      allow to rise in a warm place until it has doubled in size.
    </p>

    <p>
      Transfer the dough back to the floured work surface. Pat into a slightly
      rounded rectangle, then cut into eight equal squares. Use your hands to
      shape and pat the squares into discs. Arrange the buns on a floured baking
      sheet, cover, and let rise until they've doubled in size.
    </p>
    <p>
      Brush the buns with an egg wash and sprinkle with sesame seeds. Bake in a
      preheated oven until lightly browned. Remove from the oven, allow the buns
      to cool, and slice in half lengthwise to serve.
    </p>

    <h4>How to Store Hamburger Buns</h4>

    <p>
      Store the homemade hamburger buns in an airtight container or wrapped in
      foil at room temperature for up to five days. Avoid short term
      refrigeration, as this will dry them out.
    </p>

    <h4>Can You Freeze Hamburger Buns?</h4>

    <p>
      Yes, you can freeze homemade hamburger buns (though they're best enjoyed
      fresh). Transfer the cooled buns to a freezer-safe container, then wrap in
      a layer of foil. Label with the date and freeze for up to two months. Thaw
      on a paper towel at room temperature. When it's about halfway thawed, flip
      the bun, and replace the paper towel.
    </p>

    <h4>Allrecipes Community Tips and Praise</h4>

    <p>
      "This recipe was so simple and fun to make," according to Kris Allfrey.
      "The hamburger buns were so light and the crumb texture was perfect. I
      followed the recipe and Chef John's instructions to the letter. I wouldn't
      change a thing about this recipe. They are excellent for pulled-pork
      sandwiches."
    </p>

    <p>
      "I didn't make any changes except for what I put on top of the buns. I put
      dried onion, parsley, sesame seeds, and poppy seeds," says Ron
      Doty-Tolaro. "Also, as a rule of thumb, when making any kind of rising
      bread, lightly push in on the dough with one finger. If the dough is ready
      it will bounce back out. If the indentation stays in, knead it more."
    </p>

    <p>
      "Loved the buns," raves Mysti Williams. "I made them for burgers the first
      time. Tonight, I'm making them for Sloppy Joes. Can't wait. Truly
      delicious."
